# JSimpleSim
When building multi-agent simulations you want to focus on your model and the interaction of the agents. Looking for a suitable software can be tedious: Some simulation frameworks are easy to use, but hardly customizable for your task. Others are highly customizable but model building is a software development project of itself. And execution speed is yet another topic.

JSimpleSim offers a sensible balance between fast familiarization with the software, good adaptation to your modelling project and fast simulation speed. Written in Java and based on the discrete-event approach (DES), it has the following features:

- Easy model building
- Powerful messaging system and efficient event queues
- Separation of modelling and simulation – just try another simulator with the same model!
- Sequential and concurrent simulation execution available
- Dynamic model changes during a simulation run
- Instrumentation on the fly - monitor individual agents and evaluate their data  
- Flexibility: cellular automata, hierarchical or meshed models – one tool for all.
