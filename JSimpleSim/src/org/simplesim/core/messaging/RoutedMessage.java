 * If using a {@link org.simplesim.model.RoutingDomain.RoutingPort RoutingPort} to use the routing functionality,
 * messages have to be derived from this class.
 * <p>
 * The addresses describe the model's branch within the model tree as int arrays. The level of the tree is the index of
 * the array whereas the actual number is the id of the agent within the model level. The level of the root domain is
 * always 0.
