/**
 * Implements all basic functionality of an agent.
 * <p>
 * Agents are the acting entities of the simulation model. They should implement
 * a strategy within their {@link #doEvent(Time)} method. This is usually done
 * by the following five steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>read the messages from the inports
 * ({@link org.simplesim.core.messaging.Message})
 * <li>modify the agent's state ({@link State})
 * <li>compute output and write messages to other entities to the outports
 * <li>add events to the internal event queue if necessary
 * ({@link org.simplesim.core.scheduling.EventQueue})
 * <li>return the time of the next local event
 * ({@link org.simplesim.core.scheduling.Time})
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Agents are always embedded in an {@code AbstractDomain} for
 * compartmentalization.
 *
 * @param <S> type of the agent state containing all state variables
 * @param <E> type of the events
 * 
 * @see AbstractDomain
